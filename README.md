Embrace the learning process and take the first step to start living your life.

Living decades of a boring life is worse than experiencing one day of adventure. Ignore your excuses and just start doing.


I started with C++ as my first programming language in university, even though I didn’t want to.

in this repo i have all my assignments manuals and practice work. 
I know some of the program names look a bit messy—just ignore that. 
Initially, I was exhausted by a lot of assignments and errors, but as I began to understand more, it became interesting. now i enjoy solving problems and errors quickly.
